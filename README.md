This package provides two simple functions (30 lines of code in total):

- `assert(fact, ...)`: think of it as `message(fact)` + `stopifnot(...)`

- `test_pkg(package)`: runs tests with all objects (exported or
  non-exported) in the package namespace directly available, so no need to
  use the triple-colon `package:::name` for non-exported objects

## Why?

Because it is tedious to type these commands repeatedly in
tests:

```r
message('checking if these numbers are equal...')
stopifnot(all.equal(1, 1+1e-10), 10*.1 == 1)

message('checking if a non-exported function works...')
stopifnot(is.character(package:::utility_foo(x = 'abcd', y = 1:100)))
```

With the two simple functions above, we type six letters (`assert`) instead
of sixteen (`message` + `stopifnot`), and `assert` is also a more intuitive
function name for testing purposes (you _assert_ a fact followed by evidence):

```r
assert('These numbers are equal', {

  (all.equal(1, 1 + 1e-10))

  (10 * .1 == 1)

})

assert('A non-exported function works', {
  res = utility_foo(x = 'abcd', y = 1:100)
  (is.character(res))
})

assert('T is TRUE and F is FALSE by default, but can be changed', {
  (T == TRUE )
  (F == FALSE)

  T = FALSE
  (T == FALSE)
})
```

## R CMD check

Put the tests under the directory `pkg_name/tests/testit/` (where `pkg_name`
is the root directory of your package), and write a `test-all.R` under
`pkg_name/tests/`:

```r
library(testit)
test_pkg('pkg_name')
```

That is all for `R CMD check`. For package development, it is recommended to
use [**devtools**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools). In
particular, `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L` in RStudio makes all objects in a package
visible to you, and you can run tests interactively.

## Installation

Stable version on CRAN:

```r
install.packages('testit')
```

Development version:

```r
devtools::install_github('yihui/testit')
```

## More

How about [**testthat**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat)? Well,
this package is far less sophisticated than **testthat**. There is nothing
fancy in this package. Please do consider **testthat** if your tests require
more granularity. I myself do not use **testthat** because I'm too lazy to learn
the new vocabulary (`testthat::expect_xxx`). For **testit**, I do not need to
think if I should use `expect_equal`, `expect_equivalent`, or
`expect_identical`; I just write test conditions in parentheses that are expected to return `TRUE`. That
is the only single rule to remember.

There is no plan to add new features or reinvent anything in this package.
It is an intentionally tiny package.

Although he did not really mean it,
[Xunzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xunzi) said something that happens to
apply well to unit testing:
